		  <h3>BRILLIANT BLUE WATER - THE EUPHOTIC ZONE</h3>
		  <p>
		    The uppermost layer of the ocean that receives the most sunlight. Plants and coral thrive in this layer of the sea, and over 90% of marine life is found between 100 and 650 feet deep.

		  <h3>WHERE SUNLIGHT DIMS - THE DISPHOTIC ZONE</h3>
		  <p>
		    Since seawater absorbs and distorts sunlight, the middle layer of the world's oceans receive only faint, filtered light. In clear water, the disphotic zone can begin at depths up to 600 feet; in murky water, it can start at only 50 feet deep. The disphotic zone extends to about 3,300 feet deep. On average, this zone extends from 660 to 3,300 feet (200 to 1,000 m)

		  <h3>DARKNESS ALL AROUND - THE APHOTIC ZONE</h3>
		  <p>
		    Sometimes refered to as the dark ocean, this zone extends to the ocean floor. Depending on location, season, and turbidity of the water, this zone may start as shallow as 50 feet or as deep as 800 feet.

		  <h3>LIFE WITHOUT LIGHT - THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA</h3>
		  <p>
		    Several zones actually exist on the way to the ocean floor. Organisms is this zone evolve to live completely without light, save bioluminesence. Plankton, jellyfish, and myriad invertebrate species live their whole lives in darkness, under crushing water pressure.
